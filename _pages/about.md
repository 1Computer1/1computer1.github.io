Hi! My interests include:

- Experimenting in Haskell.
- Learning about programming language design.
- Trying to learn type theory.

[Check me out on Github!](https://github.com/1Computer1)  
I mostly write Haskell, TypeScript, and things related to programming languages or Discord bots.  

My non-programming interests include:

- Playing roguelite games.
- Constructing and solving crosswords.
- Creating difficult, enjoyable maps on osu!.
- Enjoying Japanese media like anime and manga. Touhou is my favorite!
