Hi! My interests include:

- Experimenting in Haskell.
- Learning about programming language design.
- Trying to learn type theory.

[Check me out on Github!](https://github.com/1Computer1)  
I mostly write little libraries and tools for Discord bots.  

My non-programming interests include:

- Playing rogue-lite games.
- Creating maps on osu!
- Enjoying anime and manga.
